# Smart-Search

This is an AI-powered document search engine — think of it like a "custom Google" for PDFs, Word docs, etc. that users upload. 

Instead of keyword-based search (like Ctrl+F), it uses semantic search and AI-generated answers. A user can ask, "What are the key takeaways from this report?" and the system responds intelligently using the content in the uploaded files. 

The purpose is to let users ask natural-language questions about their documents and get contextual, intelligent answers — no need to read the whole thing or remember where things are. 

This is super useful for: 

Analysts reviewing long reports 

Lawyers parsing case files 

Students studying PDFs 

Teams searching through internal documentation
